Potatoes are a staple crop in many parts of the world and are susceptible to a range of diseases.
In this project, we developed an efficient and robust disease detected system for potato leaves to improve crops health and yield. 
This automated system will take an input as an image for the user and process them using several image processing algorithms, classify them into different disease categories. 
The system will output the classification result, including the disease type, to the user interface for further analysis and action.

The disease detection system will benefit potato growers by providing a quick and accurate way to identify diseases in potato leaves. 
This will enable growers to take timely action, such as targeted treatment, to improve crop health and yield.
